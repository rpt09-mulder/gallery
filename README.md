# Recreating the Airbnb.com gallery module

It's been a long time since I've had to do any serious front-end work, so this is a welcome challenge for me. The last time I did anything of this complexity, we were still limited to floats and negative margin hacks.

I'm super excited to get up to speed with some of the new nicities, specifically:

### CSS Grid
Can't wait. Didn't wait, actually. After getting the basis of my dev environment up and running, I dove into CSS Grid and was able to flesh out the basic structure of this component in about 15 minutes.

This first stab focused only on desktop, so I'll need to set up some breakpoints and definitions for tablet and phone viewports.

### Animation in React
I'm still considering whether I should handle all animations with just pure vanilla CSS, or go with a library such as Pose by PopMotion. We shall see.
